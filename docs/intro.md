# Accessing WRDS Datasets in Python

Wharton Research Data Services (**WRDS**) offers a multitude of ways to access the datasets they host.  A few of which include:

* Web Query Forms through the [Online Platform](https://wrds-www.wharton.upenn.edu)
* [WRDS SAS Studio](https://wrds-cloud.wharton.upenn.edu/SASStudio/index?locale=en_US) 
* [WRDS R Studio](https://wrds-rstudio.wharton.upenn.edu/auth-sign-in?appUri=%2F) 
* [WRDS JupyterHub](https://wrds-jupyter.wharton.upenn.edu/hub/login?next=%2Fhub%2F) 
* [The WRDS Cloud](https://wrds-www.wharton.upenn.edu/pages/grid-items/accessing-wrds-cloud/)
* Various Libraries allow you to connect to WRDS from your computer

To seamlessly integrate your **WRDS** queries into your research workflow, you can access the **WRDS** API from Python with the [`wrds`](https://pypi.org/project/wrds/) package. 
This package will enable you to connect to **WRDS** anywhere including your own computer or **KLC**.
